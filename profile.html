	<p id="profile-text">Hi, my name is Nick. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, then attended Brandeis University in Massachusetts, where I received a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2017. Since then I have worked to further hone my technical skills by delving into desktop and web application development through multiple personal and collaborative projects, as well as classes that focus on teaching popular technologies. In the near future I hope to join a company, big or small, and begin my career as a software engineer. Ultimately, I would like to work in the space industry to help fulfill my dream of contributing to humanity's exploration and understanding of the universe.</p>
