					The first time I tried to have this picture taken at my college's career fair, it rained, soaked my shirt through my coat, and I had to go home. I waited a year for the next career fair, and it rained again. That time I brought an umbrella. It was just barely enough. Maybe you can see the relief in my eyes.
					<br>
					What was I doing at college, anyway? I was at Brandeis University working towards a Computer Science degree I have since finished. Here's more text so that I can see how this layout works. One day I was walking down the street with Fawkes but it was raining. In fact, there was so much mist that Fawkes was squinting like we were underneath a waterfall or something. Then he knocked me down and stole the treats I was carrying. Subsequently, he ran back home. And that's the end of that story!
					<br>
					Both of these stories involve rain, probably because there was a rainstorm the first day of class.
