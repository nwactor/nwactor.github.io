					The first time I tried to have this picture taken at my college's career fair, it rained, soaked my shirt through my coat, and I had to go home. I waited a year for the next career fair, and it rained again. That time I brought an umbrella. It was just barely enough. Maybe you can see the relief in my eyes.
					<br>
					What was I doing at college, anyway? I was at Brandeis University working towards a Computer Science degree, which I finished a few months later in May 2017. Since then, I have traveled in Australia and the U.S., created a desktop application, and, most recently, enrolled in this bootcamp.
